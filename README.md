## Work out Gym Management API

### Created By David Couch 8/17/2021

## About

This is an application made to create a database which holds locations, gyms, members, employees, visits, averages, and shifts. This is a work in process to explore the functionality of automation and complex systems.

- `locations`: Locations will be stored for gyms, members and employees.
- `gyms`: This will be the gym that will have members, and employees.
- `members`: Members will have visits.
    - `visits`: this will when the user signs in and signs out. This can be used to judge how long a user spends at the gym on average.
    - 'averages': This will be where the averages of the users time spent will be held. This process will be handled by the API. An automated system will be put in place to add new entries to track visiter behavior.
- `employees`: employees will have shifts.
    - `shifts`: this will be for when the employee clocks in ands clocks out.

### Goals
- Automated Jobs to calculate users average time at the gym.
- minimum queries per route visit.

## `Install & Run on your machine  :`
***
* These instructions assume you have ruby, rails, & postgres installed
* Install [Ruby and Rails](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/getting-started-with-ruby/installing-ruby)
* Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/getting-started-with-ruby/installing-postgres)
***

* Go to ( https://github.com/dcouch440/rails_workout_api ).

*  Navigate to the code button on the Github website.

* Click on the code button to open the menu.

- Copy the HTTPS code by clicking the clipboard next to the link.

- Within your Bash terminal navigate to your desired location by using cd fallowed by your desired directory.

```bash
 cd Desktop
```

- Once you have chosen your desired directory use the command.

* Then after the process is completed use the command.
```
  cd (the file name that you saved it as)
```

* now open the project with ( code is the code name for vs code )

``` bash
code .
```

For windows users navigate to the database.yml file to set your username and password.

```
Setup postgresql for rails

	üìÅ config > üìë database.yml
        default: &default
          adapter: postgresql ‚úîÔ∏è
          encoding: unicode
          pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
          username: (username here) ‚úîÔ∏è
          password: (password here) ‚úîÔ∏è

```
* If you wish to keep these private you can also use a credentials password or an ENV file

* Note : we use <%= %> inside the database file because we are not within a ruby file.

### `Credentials`
* See this link to learn how to do so. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHgvPPr2nLE )

* Start off by deleting your credentials.yml.enc file and master.key (within config folder) in order to generate another

```
  For vs code users try (within the terminal)
  EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```

* Within the file add then close the file to save

```
  pg_database_username: add username here
  pg_database_password: add password here
```

* Then inside the database.yml (see description above) add (or uncomment)

```
  username: <%= Rails.application.credentials.pg_database_username %>
  password: <%= Rails.application.credentials.pg_database_password %>
```

* Thats all for credentials

### `ENV`
* start by adding the gem
```
gem 'dotenv-rails'
```

* add a .env file to your main directory

```
touch .env
```

* within your file add your key and value (no quotes)

```
FIRST_VALUE_NAME='FIRST_VALUE'
SECOND_VALUE_NAME='SECOND_VALUE'
```

* Then from within your files you can call on these files as such

```
  username: <%= ENV['PG_USERNAME'] %>
  password: <%= ENV['PG_PASSWORD'] %>
```

* Thats all for .env files

* Within the main directory of the project create your databases with

```
rails db:create
```

```
rails db:migrate
```

* From here to start the server you will need to type in:

```
  rails s
```

* visit localhost:3000 to view the app
